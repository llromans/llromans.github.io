        <h1>HTML 3.0</h1>
        <p>Netscape released proprietary tags that gave a lot more control but broke your wepage in other browsers, there was a team that made the draft or html 3 but it was ignored and only a few bits were implemented, this came to describe those types of tags like the ones netscape made.</p>

        <br>
        <h1>HTML 3.2</h1>
